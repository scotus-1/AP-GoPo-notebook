>  Hobbe's work *Leviathan* argues for a monarchy to rule over a "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" life if humans were left to their devices a.k.a. a democracy similar to arguments made in [[Brutus I]]. He also argued for the #social_contract with the government, and believed that the government should protect the natural rights / #inalienable_rights of its citizens, and the citizens should respect the government.
