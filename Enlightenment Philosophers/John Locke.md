>  John Locke in his *Second Treatise on Civil Government* belived and popularized the idea of **"life, liberty, and property"** as part of human's #inalienable_rights granted by God. It was the duty of all governments to protect these rights such as in the #social_contract. He also believed for every man to be equal or born on neutral footing.
