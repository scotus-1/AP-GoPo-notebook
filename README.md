## Formating
Currently most are organized via tags denoting either definitions or groups of ideas, that do or do not yet have specific pages. Otherwise, it traditionally organized using backlinks. Each document uses mainly blocks `>` a seperated by different headers with main sections H2, then with H3. With callouts used conservatively, but mainly at the end of large pages.
