#federalists #founding_document 

> Federalist 51 was argued by James Madison for the defense and implementation of #checks_and_balances and #seperation_of_powers initially idealized by [[Charles de Montesquieu]]. This was to ensure that no #factions could overthrow the status quo. Not to mention, it make the government more efficient and provide adequately for states.

## Double Protection #double_protection
> Double protection is the idea of shutting down rebellious #factions either through the other branches of governement or through the division between federal, state, and local governments. 

> [!summary] 
>  If a rebellious faction to arise, the structure of government would be adequate to shut down such faction laterally and horizontally. For example, if the judiciary branch where to act out of line, the other branches being legislative and executive could shut it down. If it were on the federal level, both the state and local levels could shut it down hence double protection.
